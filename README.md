# FoodHub Project

In this project, I perform exploratory data analysis to get insights to answer questions that will help the company improve the business and offer great recommendations.

## About Project
Living in major cities can be overwhelming, but having access to reliable information about highly rated restaurants and efficient food delivery services can significantly 
enhance the dining experience. In response to this need, a food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.
The food aggregator company has stored the data of the orders the registered customers made in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get insights and a fair idea about the demand of different 
restaurants, which will help them enhance their customer experience. In doing this, they have also shared questions that must be answered.
